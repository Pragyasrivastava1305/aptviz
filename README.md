# Applied Topology Visualizations

The applied topology visualiation (ApTViz) package contains functions designed to create data graphics from common TDA analyses and structures. Visualization functions rely on some combination of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), JavaScript, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), and [D3](https://observablehq.com/@d3).
